This extension adds a button to VSCode that lets you instantly restart the Extension Host or reload the entire window with a single click (or via mouse-over). It simplifies the development process by eliminating the need to search for commands in the Command Palette, thereby enhancing efficiency and easing debugging.

# Features

- Adds a customizable status bar button for quick access
- Provides two restart options via one-click:
  - **Restart Extension Host:** Restarts only the Extension Host process
  - **Reload Window:** Reloads the entire VS Code window
- Instantly accessible via a simple click or by hovering over the status bar button

# Usage

   - **`Cancel`:** Closes the options without taking any action
